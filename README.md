# open-source-diabetes
An experiment in making my diabetes open source.
This repo acts as the first step in making my diabetes open source. It's very early in it's tracks, and the project scope is still being decided in issue #2.

### Background
I'm a developer, designer and tinkerer. In my first year of high school I designed a concept for a blood glucose meter that measured your BG contionusley, a couple of years later (unrelated to my concept) that concept existed (it's called CGM, Contionous Glucose Monitoring). After using a CGM I starting playing with the concept of an open platform where this data could be collected, visualized and made available to researchers/diabetics/doctors etc. Before developing the software I did some research and found the [Tidepool project](https://github.com/tidepool-org), which is the exact same thing (but further developed) that i envisioned. Hurray!

This repo acts as a playground for how to make my personal diabetes data more valuable, by open sourcing it and making it available for visualization/analysis.
